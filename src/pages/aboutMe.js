            <p> Name is David Elijah Rios, I am a Software Developer ready to take my skills and passion for design and functionality to complete 
                any client request and challenge given to me. I have the strong belief that you are never "done" learning, and with that mindset, I wish to use 
                what experience and skills I have acquired, to strengthen a company but also, continue to refine my skills and knowledge. </p>

                <p>I have a passion for technology and music, and love to tinker with projects and do what I can to challenge myself to help sharpen my skill set.
                However, When I am not developing, I enjoying playing the Bass Guitar and going out and eating delicious foods and trying new food places or 
                revisiting my favorite places.
